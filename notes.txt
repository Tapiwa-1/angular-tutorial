1.2 Create Hello world

Lesson 2: Create Home component

2.1 Conceptual preview of Angular components
Components contain the code, HTML layout and CSS styles information that provide the function and appearance of an element in the app.
An app's functions and appearance can be divided and partitioned into Components

In Angular, components have metadata that define its properties. When you create your HomeComponent, you use these properties:
selector: describe how Angular refers to the component in template
standalone: describe whether the component requires a NgModule
imports: to describe the component's dependencies
template: to describe the component's HTML markup layout
styleUrls: to list the URLs of the CSS files that the component uses in an arrary

To create home Component run: ng generate component home --standalone --inline-template --skip-tests

2.1 - Add the new component to your app's layout

open app.component.ts
import HomeComponent: import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
In app.component.ts, in @Component, update the imports array property and add HomeComponent : imports: [HomeComponent,],
