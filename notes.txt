Lesson 1: Hello world

1.1 Review the files in the project

.angular - files required to build the app
.e2e - files used to test the app
.node-modules - node packages
.angular.json - building tools
.tsconfig - app consifuration
src / - in the file explorer, find the Angular app files
++++ /app - you will find the Angular app's components file
++++ ++++ app.component.ts - the source file that describes the app-root component. 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++ - top level Angular component.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++ - building block of Angular application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -The component description includes the components code, HTML template and styles, which can be described in deperate files
++++ ++++ app.component.css - is the style sheet for this component
++++ ++++ New component also added in this directory
++++ /assets - contains images to be used by the app
++++ index.html - app's top level html template
++++ style.css - app's top level style sheet
++++ main.ts -where the app start running
++++ fav.ico - app icon

1.2 Create Hello world

- replace title in index.html with homes
- add template: `<h1>Hello world!</h1>`, in the @Component({})

Lesson 2: Create Home component

2.1 Conceptual preview of Angular components
Components contain the code, HTML layout and CSS styles information that provide the function and appearance of an element in the app.
An app's functions and appearance can be divided and partitioned into Components

In Angular, components have metadata that define its properties. When you create your HomeComponent, you use these properties:
selector: describe how Angular refers to the component in template
standalone: describe whether the component requires a NgModule
imports: to describe the component's dependencies
template: to describe the component's HTML markup layout
styleUrls: to list the URLs of the CSS files that the component uses in an arrary

To create home Component run: ng generate component home --standalone --inline-template --skip-tests

2.1 - Add the new component to your app's layout

open app.component.ts
import HomeComponent: import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
In app.component.ts, in @Component, update the imports array property and add HomeComponent : imports: [HomeComponent,],

Lesson 3: Creating an interface

Conceptual preview of interface
Are custom data types for your application

To create interface: ng generate interface housinglocation

Lesson 4: Add an input parameter to the component
This tutorial lesson demonstrates how to create a component @Input() and use it to pass data to a component for customization.
Inputs allow components to share data. The direction of the data sharing is from parent component to child component.
In this lesson, you'll define @Input() properties in the HousingLocationComponent component which will enable you to customize the data displayed in the component.

Step 1 - Import the Input decorator
When adding a property binding to a component tag, we use the [attribute] = "value" syntax to notify Angular that the assigned value should be treated as a property from the component class and not a string value.

Lesson 5: Add an interpolation to a componentâ€™s template
